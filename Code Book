Code Book

the dataset is a UCI HAR Dataset downloaded from the Getting and Cleaning data peer graded assignment by John Hopkins University
The working space was cleared and the dplyr package was loaded into the workspace
The UCI HAR consist of subject data, training data and test data which was merged into one dataset using the rbind and cbind function called "full_data" 
The combined dataset "full_data" originally consists of 563 variables and over 10,0000 observations
Variable measurements for the mean and standard deviation were extracted to create a new data set with 88 variables called "extracted_data" using the select function in the dplyr package
The variable names for the extracted_data were modified as follows:

The code variable in the original data set was renamed to activity
"Acc" was replaced with its full name accelerometer
"Gyro" was named to Gyroscope
"BodyBody" was modified to Body
mag modified to magnitude
"t" at the beginning of every variable name was modified to Time
"f" renamed to frequency
"meanfreq" renamed to meanfrequency
"tbody" changed to time body
"angle" changed to "Angle"
The dots in the variable names was replaced with underscore
multiple underscores were replaced with just a single underscore.
periods at the end of variable names were removed

A new data set called "summarised_data" was created that grouped and summarised the the data by subjects and activities.
